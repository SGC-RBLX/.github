Stargate Command is a Roblox-based group centred around Area 52, a location based within the Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado.  Area 52 houses the Stargate and all personnel required to support it.

This GitHub organisation will contain most of our code and systems which help run the SGC.

If you should wish to contribute, you are free to do so.  However, please open an issue so that an appropriate implementation can be discussed prior to work being completed.
